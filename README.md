# Rootid CLI

Simple command line interface meant to simplify and automated development workflows for the Rootid.com dev team.

## Installation and Usage

Before you install, you should have Terminus and BackstopJS installed, as well as a local development workflow that's
compatible with Rootid's. Since 100% of the people installing this tool will be people within Rootid, there's no need to explain
how to set that up here.

You should be able to execute Terminus on the command line, anywhere on your system.

To install type:

`composer global require jmickela/rootid-cli`

To verify it is installed, just run the rootid command.
